It computes on-line the optimal least mean square error estimate of the state given the observed outputs, and it also computes the covariance matrix of the state estimation error. Using the state estimate and the covariance matrix, a confidence ellipsoid for the true state can be constructed under the assumption that the noise in the system is Gaussian.\nIn many applications some values of the states are more important than others, e.g. values that represent collision or near-collision of two robots, unsafe operating conditions etc. Such events usually have low a priori probability to happen and the Kalman Filter fails to provide adequate estimates and confidence ellipsoids of such rare events. In this talk a state estimation algorithm which under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, delivers confidence ellipsoids which contain the true state, regardless of its value, with a given probability is presented. The results will first be introduced for the static case, and before extended to the dynamic case.\nJoint work with Algo Care and Marco Campi, University of Brescia, Italy.\nRef: A. Care, M.

While Kalman filtering technique has achieved a great success in tracking a moving target over the past few decades, it requires some model assumption on the target dynamics and noise statistics. In this talk, we consider a time-varying optimization approach to the target tracking problem using noisy time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, which imposes only minimal assumptions on the target trajectory and/or noise distribution. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a sequence of TOA-based source localization problem and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to generate sequential updates of the target. To analyze the tracking performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of the (static) TOA-based source localization problem. Under standard assumptions on the TOA measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at different noise levels.\nBiography: Yuen-Man Pun is currently a postdoctoral fellow with CIICADA Lab, School of Engineering at Australian National University.

In this talk we present two scenarios where hybrid techniques can be used to solve two important estimation problems. In the first part, we consider the scenario where a system transmits its measurements to an observer via a digital network. In this context, an important question is when a transmission needs to occur over the network to obtain accurate state estimates, while only sporadically using the communication channel. For this purpose, we present a (hybrid) event-triggered observer design. In the second part of the talk, we use hybrid techniques with the aim of improving the estimation performance of a given robust nominal observer designed for a general nonlinear continuous-time system. We present for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal one and additional dynamical systems that differ from the nominal observer only in their output injection gains, that are collectively referred to as modes. We then evaluate the estimation cost of each mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at each time instant. Different strategies are proposed to reset, or not, the modes which are not selected at each switching instant. Simulation results show that the nominal observer performances can be significantly improved with the proposed scheme.\nBiography: Elena Petri is a PhD student at CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France, under the supervision of Romain Postoyan (CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France), Dragan Nesic (University of Melbourne, Australia) and Daniele Astolfi (LAGEPP, Université Lyon 1, France).

In particular, we investigate the potential degree of freedom of small-scale distributed storage devices (such as batteries) and flexible loads in the grid. The corresponding control laws, scheduling the charging and discharging behaviour of the storage devices and the controllable loads, are within the area of demand-side management.
