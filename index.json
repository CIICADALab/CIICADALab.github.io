More precisely, we show that a minimal LTI strictly proper system can be rendered NI using full state feedback if and only if it can be output transformed into a system, which has relative degree less than or equal to two and is weakly minimum phase.

Various techniques have been proposed to solve this state estimation problem, such as Luenberger-like observers and extended Kalman filter, which are also widely used in real world systems. In the last 20 years, driving by the unmanned aerial vehicle industry, there has been a burst of works in novel geometric observer design for attitude and pose estimation by exploiting the symmetry of the systems. This leads to my research topic of equivariant observer designs. In this Thesis Proposal Review, two papers are presented. One proposed a general filter design methodology of discrete-time systems on homogeneous spaces, while the other one presented how this filter can be applied to inertial navigation systems. Additionally, plan for future work that extends the current filter architecture are detailed with short-term plans, both coming with derivations. The future direction addresses how I would like to generalize the current work onto a broader class of systems, with some early-stage insights of the ideas. The resources and logistics required for the future plans are provided.\n","date":"February 10, 2023","permalink":"/seminars/shawnge/","section":"","summary":"Title: Equivariant Observer Design for Discrete-time Systems\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 10 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: State observer design for nonlinear systems is a key field in control theories.","title":"Shawn Ge's Talk on Equivariant Observer Design for Discrete-time Systems"},{"content":"Title: Regret Analysis of Online LQR Control via Trajectory Prediction and Tracking\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 3 February, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose and analyse a new method for online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control with a priori unknown time-varying cost matrices. The cost matrices are revealed sequentially with future values to be previewed over a short window. Our novel method involves using the available cost matrices to predict the optimal trajectory along with a tracking controller to drive the system towards it which is less \u0026ldquo;pessimistic\u0026rdquo; than other existing methods. We adopted the notion of dynamic regret to measure the performance of this proposed online LQR control method, with our main result being that the (dynamic) regret of our method is upper bounded by a constant. Moreover, the regret upper bound decays exponentially with the preview window length, and is extendable to systems with disturbances.

This fact is utilized for analysis of the behavior of coupled oscillators and for explaining how a large number of agents in a group can enhance the robustness of the group.

However, the growing availability of data and advancements in computing power has given rise to a resurgence of operator-theoretic approaches such as the Koopman framework, which has been realised in algorithms like the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Such approaches involve embedding a nonlinear, finite-dimensional system in an infinite-dimensional space of functions, whose time evolution can be described by a linear operator. Along similar lines, this tutorial-style talk will discuss how the evolution of the value function for a nonlinear optimal control problem can be approximated in a computationally efficient manner. In particular, the Dynamic Programming Principle, which relates the value function at two time points, is a linear operator in a max-plus semi-vector space of functions. This then allows the value function to be evolved as if it were a discrete-time linear system. The talk will be packaged in a way that is accessible with only a basic understanding of linear algebra.\n","date":"January 13, 2023","permalink":"/seminars/vincentliu/","section":"","summary":"Title: An Introduction to Max-Plus Algebra and its Application to Optimal Control Problems\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 13 January, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: Control, estimation, and system identification of nonlinear systems continues to be a challenging problem owing to a lack of structure imposed by most problem settings.","title":"Vincent Liu's talk on An Introduction to Max-Plus Algebra and its Application to Optimal Control Problems"},{"content":"We have a double-bill.\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 9 January, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nThe details are given below.\nTitle: Structure-exploiting optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems\nAbstract: We consider optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems by minimizing the energy supplied via the ports. Albeit this intrinsic choice of the cost functional, the resulting optimal control problem can be singular, i.e., it is in general not coercive in the control variable. However to the dissipative structure of port-Hamiltonian systems and the strong intertwinement of cost and dynamics, we show under suitable assumptions that, despite this singularity, optimal controls exist, can be characterized by optimality conditions and exhibit a particular stability behavior towards a conservative subspace.\nTitle: Model predictive control for systems with null-controllable homogeneous approximation\nAbstract: The stabilization of non-holonomic mobile robots is challenging according to A. Astolfi, see [1]. In particular, it was shown in [2] that the set-point stabilization cannot be achieved using MPC based on quadratic costs without stabilizing terminal conditions. A remedy is the use of tailored stage or terminal costs, see, e.g. [3]. In the first part of the talk, we recap these findings. Then, we present the framework proposed in [4], which allows to systematically design stage costs such that local asymptotic stability of the origin w.r.t. the MPC closed loop is ensured for a system class including the mobile-robot example. To this end, we show that cost controllability, a sufficient stability condition, holds making use of the homogeneous approximation.\n[1] A. Astolfi: Discontinuous control of nonholonomic systems.

Existing solutions provide limited stability guarantees, relying on local linearisation, high gain design, or assuming specific trajectories such as constant acceleration of the vehicle. In this presentation, I discuss a novel non-linear observer for inertial VAA with almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable error dynamics. The approach exploits Lie group symmetries of the system dynamics to construct a globally valid correction term. To the authors\u0026rsquo; knowledge, this construction is the first observer to provide almost global convergence for the inertial VAA problem. The observer performance is verified in simulation, where it is shown that the estimation error converges to zero even with an extremely poor initial condition.\nTitle: Exploiting Symmetries for Trajectory Tracking Control (with Application to Quadrotors) by Matthew Hampsey\nAbstract: High performance trajectory tracking control of quadrotor vehicles is an important challenge in aerial robotics. Symmetry is a fundamental property of physical systems and offers the potential to provide a tool to design high-performance control algorithms. We propose a design methodology that takes any given symmetry, linearises the associated error in a single set of coordinates, and uses LQR design to obtain a high performance control; an approach we term Equivariant Regulator design. We show that quadrotor vehicles admit several different symmetries: the direct product symmetry, the extended pose symmetry and the pose and velocity symmetry, and show that each symmetry can be used to define a global error. We compare the linearised systems via simulation and find that the extended pose and pose and velocity symmetries outperform the direct product symmetry in the presence of large disturbances. This suggests that choices of equivariant and group affine symmetries have improved linearisation error.\n","date":"December 9, 2022","permalink":"/seminars/mh_pvg/","section":"","summary":"We have a double-bill.\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 9 December, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nThe details are given below.\nTitle: Constructive Equivariant Observer Design for Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude by Pieter van Goor","title":"Pieter van Goor's Talk on Constructive Equivariant Observer Design for Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude and Matthew Hampsey's Talk on Exploiting Symmetries for Trajectory Tracking Control"},{"content":"Title: SubT and Beyond: Experiences at the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and Putting Robots to Work\nTime, Date, Location: 15:00, Wednesday, 7 December, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: he DARPA SubT Challenge concluded in September 2021, Team CSIRO Data61 placed second, securing 1 million USD for Australian robotics.

First, we consider how measurement leaks about a linear, discrete, time-invariant system\u0026rsquo;s dynamics helps an adversary to calculate attacks that are difficult to detect. It turns out that these undetectable attacks can be generated with small amounts of input-output data using Willems’ Fundamental Lemma. Insight into the attack generation shows that security may be obtained through sudden changes in the system. In the second part of the talk, we will consider how injected measurement noise makes these sudden events difficult to estimate for an adversary. In particular, we use the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to provide lower bounds on the estimation error variance of when the change has occurred, which is difficult to do with traditional methods such as Cramér-Rao due to the time-step being discrete. We also present extensions of to our analysis to nonlinear systems and to simultaneous estimation of the amplitude and the time-step of the change using the Barankin bound. The latter result enables us to design open-loop control sequences that reduce information leakage. Finally, we use numerical simulations to verify our results in a smart-home setting, and to show how a forensic analysis can be made.\nBiography: Rijad Alisic is a Ph.D. student with the Division of Decision and Control Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of Henrik Sandberg and co-supervisor Karl Henrik Johansson.

It computes on-line the optimal least mean square error estimate of the state given the observed outputs, and it also computes the covariance matrix of the state estimation error. Using the state estimate and the covariance matrix, a confidence ellipsoid for the true state can be constructed under the assumption that the noise in the system is Gaussian.\nIn many applications some values of the states are more important than others, e.g. values that represent collision or near-collision of two robots, unsafe operating conditions etc. Such events usually have low a priori probability to happen and the Kalman Filter fails to provide adequate estimates and confidence ellipsoids of such rare events. In this talk a state estimation algorithm which under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, delivers confidence ellipsoids which contain the true state, regardless of its value, with a given probability is presented. The results will first be introduced for the static case, and before extended to the dynamic case.\nJoint work with Algo Care and Marco Campi, University of Brescia, Italy.\nRef: A. Care, M.

While Kalman filtering technique has achieved a great success in tracking a moving target over the past few decades, it requires some model assumption on the target dynamics and noise statistics. In this talk, we consider a time-varying optimization approach to the target tracking problem using noisy time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, which imposes only minimal assumptions on the target trajectory and/or noise distribution. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a sequence of TOA-based source localization problem and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to generate sequential updates of the target. To analyze the tracking performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of the (static) TOA-based source localization problem. Under standard assumptions on the TOA measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at different noise levels.\nBiography: Yuen-Man Pun is currently a postdoctoral fellow with CIICADA Lab, School of Engineering at Australian National University.

In this talk we present two scenarios where hybrid techniques can be used to solve two important estimation problems. In the first part, we consider the scenario where a system transmits its measurements to an observer via a digital network. In this context, an important question is when a transmission needs to occur over the network to obtain accurate state estimates, while only sporadically using the communication channel. For this purpose, we present a (hybrid) event-triggered observer design. In the second part of the talk, we use hybrid techniques with the aim of improving the estimation performance of a given robust nominal observer designed for a general nonlinear continuous-time system. We present for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal one and additional dynamical systems that differ from the nominal observer only in their output injection gains, that are collectively referred to as modes. We then evaluate the estimation cost of each mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at each time instant. Different strategies are proposed to reset, or not, the modes which are not selected at each switching instant. Simulation results show that the nominal observer performances can be significantly improved with the proposed scheme.\nBiography: Elena Petri is a PhD student at CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France, under the supervision of Romain Postoyan (CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France), Dragan Nesic (University of Melbourne, Australia) and Daniele Astolfi (LAGEPP, Université Lyon 1, France).
