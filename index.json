The cost matrices are revealed sequentially with future values to be previewed over a short window. Our novel method involves using the available cost matrices to predict the optimal trajectory along with a tracking controller to drive the system towards it which is less \u0026ldquo;pessimistic\u0026rdquo; than other existing methods. We adopted the notion of dynamic regret to measure the performance of this proposed online LQR control method, with our main result being that the (dynamic) regret of our method is upper bounded by a constant. Moreover, the regret upper bound decays exponentially with the preview window length, and is extendable to systems with disturbances. We show in simulations that our proposed method offers improved performance compared to other previously proposed online LQR methods.\n","date":"November 29, 2022","permalink":"/seminars/yitianchen/","section":"","summary":"Title: Regret Analysis of Online LQR Control via Trajectory Prediction and Tracking\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 29 November, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose and analyse a new method for online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control with a priori unknown time-varying cost matrices.","title":"Yitian Chen's Talk on Regret Analysis of Online LQR Control via Trajectory Prediction and Tracking"},{"content":"The book “Introduction to Nonlinear Control: Stability, Control Design, and Estimation” by Chris Kellett and Philipp Braun can now be pre-ordered from Princeton University Press.\nThe book offers an introductory text on the analysis, control and estimation of nonlinear systems appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.\n","date":"November 22, 2022","permalink":"/news/nonlinbook/","section":"News","summary":"The book “Introduction to Nonlinear Control: Stability, Control Design, and Estimation” by Chris Kellett and Philipp Braun can now be pre-ordered from Princeton University Press.\nThe book offers an introductory text on the analysis, control and estimation of nonlinear systems appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.","title":"New book on “Introduction to Nonlinear Control” by Chris Kellett and Philipp Braun"},{"content":"Here we we find the latest news!\n","date":"November 22, 2022","permalink":"/news/","section":"News","summary":"Here we we find the latest news!","title":"News"},{"content":"Title: How Privacy Can Improve Security Against Data-Driven Attackers\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 18 November, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: In this talk, we will discuss methods that can be used as a first line of defence from data-driven attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). First, we consider how measurement leaks about a linear, discrete, time-invariant system\u0026rsquo;s dynamics helps an adversary to calculate attacks that are difficult to detect. It turns out that these undetectable attacks can be generated with small amounts of input-output data using Willems’ Fundamental Lemma. Insight into the attack generation shows that security may be obtained through sudden changes in the system. In the second part of the talk, we will consider how injected measurement noise makes these sudden events difficult to estimate for an adversary. In particular, we use the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to provide lower bounds on the estimation error variance of when the change has occurred, which is difficult to do with traditional methods such as Cramér-Rao due to the time-step being discrete. We also present extensions of to our analysis to nonlinear systems and to simultaneous estimation of the amplitude and the time-step of the change using the Barankin bound. The latter result enables us to design open-loop control sequences that reduce information leakage. Finally, we use numerical simulations to verify our results in a smart-home setting, and to show how a forensic analysis can be made.\nBiography: Rijad Alisic is a Ph.D. student with the Division of Decision and Control Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of Henrik Sandberg and co-supervisor Karl Henrik Johansson.

It computes on-line the optimal least mean square error estimate of the state given the observed outputs, and it also computes the covariance matrix of the state estimation error. Using the state estimate and the covariance matrix, a confidence ellipsoid for the true state can be constructed under the assumption that the noise in the system is Gaussian.\nIn many applications some values of the states are more important than others, e.g. values that represent collision or near-collision of two robots, unsafe operating conditions etc. Such events usually have low a priori probability to happen and the Kalman Filter fails to provide adequate estimates and confidence ellipsoids of such rare events. In this talk a state estimation algorithm which under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, delivers confidence ellipsoids which contain the true state, regardless of its value, with a given probability is presented. The results will first be introduced for the static case, and before extended to the dynamic case.\nJoint work with Algo Care and Marco Campi, University of Brescia, Italy.\nRef: A. Care, M.

The recently proposed equivariant filter (EqF) exploits equivariance to generate high performance filters for a wide range of real-world systems. However, existing work on the equivariant filter, and equivariance of control systems in general, is based on a continuous-time formulation. In this work, we first present the equivariant structure of a discrete-time system, as well as the link between the equivariance of a discrete-time system and its continuous-time counterpart. We then use this to propose a discrete-time version of the equivariant filter. A novelty of the approach is that the geometry of the symmetry group naturally appears as parallel transport in the reset step of the filter. Preliminary results for linear second order kinematics with separate bearing and range measurements indicate that the discrete EqF significantly outperforms both a discretised version of the continuous EqF and a classical discrete EKF.\n","date":"November 4, 2022","permalink":"/seminars/shawnge/","section":"","summary":"Title: Equivariant filter for discrete-time systems\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 4 November, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: The kinematics of many nonlinear systems, especially in the robotics field, admit a transitive Liegroup symmetry, which is useful in high performance observer design.","title":"Shawn Ge's Talk on Equivariant filter for discrete-time systems"},{"content":"Oliver gave a talk in the seminar series on behavior trees in robotics entitled What does it mean to be modular?\nFor more details you can check out this publication:\nOn modularity in reactive control architectures, with an application to formal verification O Biggar, M Zamani, I Shames ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) 6 (2), 1-36\n","date":"November 1, 2022","permalink":"/news/modularitytalk/","section":"News","summary":"Oliver gave a talk in the seminar series on behavior trees in robotics entitled What does it mean to be modular?\nFor more details you can check out this publication:","title":"What does it mean to be modular?"},{"content":"Title: Error Bound for Target Tracking Based on Time-of-Arrival Measurements\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 28 October, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: Target tracking is a key enabling technology in many applications of multi-agent systems and wireless sensor networks, such as motion planning and surveillance. While Kalman filtering technique has achieved a great success in tracking a moving target over the past few decades, it requires some model assumption on the target dynamics and noise statistics. In this talk, we consider a time-varying optimization approach to the target tracking problem using noisy time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, which imposes only minimal assumptions on the target trajectory and/or noise distribution. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a sequence of TOA-based source localization problem and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to generate sequential updates of the target. To analyze the tracking performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of the (static) TOA-based source localization problem. Under standard assumptions on the TOA measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at different noise levels.\nBiography: Yuen-Man Pun is currently a postdoctoral fellow with CIICADA Lab, School of Engineering at Australian National University.

In this talk we present two scenarios where hybrid techniques can be used to solve two important estimation problems. In the first part, we consider the scenario where a system transmits its measurements to an observer via a digital network. In this context, an important question is when a transmission needs to occur over the network to obtain accurate state estimates, while only sporadically using the communication channel. For this purpose, we present a (hybrid) event-triggered observer design. In the second part of the talk, we use hybrid techniques with the aim of improving the estimation performance of a given robust nominal observer designed for a general nonlinear continuous-time system. We present for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal one and additional dynamical systems that differ from the nominal observer only in their output injection gains, that are collectively referred to as modes. We then evaluate the estimation cost of each mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at each time instant. Different strategies are proposed to reset, or not, the modes which are not selected at each switching instant. Simulation results show that the nominal observer performances can be significantly improved with the proposed scheme.\nBiography: Elena Petri is a PhD student at CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France, under the supervision of Romain Postoyan (CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France), Dragan Nesic (University of Melbourne, Australia) and Daniele Astolfi (LAGEPP, Université Lyon 1, France).

We develop the general framework of equivariant systems theory to yield generic observer designs such as the Equivariant Filter (EqF), which has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in problems such as attitude estimation and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO). This research also examines system invariances that can be exploited to yield observers with synchronous error dynamics (depending only on a choice of correction term) and (almost-)global stability properties.
