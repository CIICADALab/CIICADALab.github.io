Specifically, we prove that every zero-sum game possesses a unique global replicator attractor, which we then characterise. Most urprisingly, this attractor depends only on each player\u0026rsquo;s preference order over their own strategies and not on the cardinal payoff values, defined by a finite directed graph we call the game\u0026rsquo;s preference graph. When the game is symmetric, this graph is a tournament whose nodes are strategies; when the game is not symmetric, this graph is the game\u0026rsquo;s response graph. We discuss the consequences of our results on chain recurrence and Nash equilibria.\nThis paper is the recipient of the Outstanding paper award from Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory\u0026rsquo;s Algorithmic Learning Theory 2024.\n","date":"1 March 2024","permalink":"/seminars/imanshames_2024/","section":"","summary":"Title: The Attractor of the Replicator Dynamic in Zero-Sum Games\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 1 March, 2024, Ian Ross Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: Abstract: In this work we characterise the long-run behaviour of the replicator dynamic in zero-sum games (symmetric or non-symmetric).","title":"Iman Shames' Talk on The Attractor of the Replicator Dynamic in Zero-Sum Games"},{"content":"Time, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 16 February, 2024, Ian Ross Building Seminar Room\nTitle: Why Misinformation Spread Fast in Social Networks, and How to Stop It\nAbstract: We discuss a misinformation spreading model where individuals are connected via a graph structure, representing a social network. Initially, only a small subset of the individuals are spreading a piece of misinformation. Each individual who is connected to a spreader starts spreading with some probability as a function of their trust in the spreader. We focus on determining the graph parameters which govern the magnitude and pace that the misinformation spreads in this model. We prove that for the misinformation to spread to a sizable fraction of the individuals, the network needs to enjoy “strong” expansion properties and most nodes should be in “well-connected” communities. Both of these characteristics are, arguably, present in real-world social networks up to a certain degree, shedding light on the driving force behind the extremely fast spread of misinformation in social networks. We, then, formulate a collection of countermeasures to stop the spread of misinformation. Our experiments on real-world graph data demonstrate that our novel decentralized countermeasures (which are executed by the individuals) outperform the previously studied centralized ones (which need to be imposed by a third entity, such as governments).\nBio: Ahad N.

The definition and characterization of uniform observability for linear time-varying systems, followed by an observer design framework exploiting first-order approximations of a class of nonlinear systems, are first recalled. The resulting Riccati observers are locally uniformly exponentially stable when associated uniform observability conditions are satisfied. The framework is subsequently applied, with detailed explanations, to a set of practical problems, namely i) classical PnP camera pose estimation using known source points and bearing measurements, ii) the adaptation of this problem to unknown source points by using epipolar constraints, iii) camera pose and velocity estimation using bearing and IMU measurements, and iv) camera velocity and depth estimation using optical flow and IMU measurements from the observation of a planar target. The observer solutions proposed for these last two problems are validated with experimental data.\nBio: Tarek Hamel is Professor at the University Côte d\u0026rsquo;Azur since 2003.

Control problems in the quantum domain are often more challenging compared to their classical counterparts, primarily due to the additional constraints imposed by quantum mechanics. A linear quantum system generally need not correspond to a physically meaningful system unless it satisfies some additional constraints which then a quantum system will be termed as a physically realizable quantum system. One way to implement a linear time-invariant (LTI) system as a physically realizable system is to include additional quantum vacuum noise channels. The presence of quantum vacuum noise channels in the controller places limits on the performance. Hence it is desirable to minimize the number (or effect) of these noises.\nThe first part of this thesis is to improve current approaches for implementing physically realizable quantum systems. In this context, we present an optimal method to implement a strictly proper LTI system as a physically realizable quantum system. This method focuses on the extent to which the additional quantum noise affects the system output. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for when a quantum system corresponding to a given LTI controller can be made physically realizable in the presence of both direct feedthrough quantum vacuum noise and additional quantum vacuum noise such that the additional quantum noise does not affect the controller output. Additionally, we give a frequency domain condition to physically realize a given transfer function matrix using only direct feedthrough quantum noise.\nCoherent quantum control is a unique feedback control paradigm with no counterpart in classical control systems. Physical realizability and coherent quantum control are closely related concepts since the condition for a quantum controller to be considered coherent is that the controller must be physically realizable. The second part of this thesis considers the quantum equalization problem. We have proposed a method to find a physically realizable suboptimal coherent linear quadratic Gaussian~(LQG) controller that minimizes a cost function related to the system equalization error. We have implemented a gradient descent approach in searching for an optimal solution for the quantum equalization problem.\nBio: Rebbecca Thien completed her Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s(2016) and Master\u0026rsquo;s (2018) degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Gyeongsang National University, South Korea.

The particular focus of this work is on particle filters to approximate time-discretisations of continuous-time Feynman-Kac path integral models --- a scenario that naturally arises when addressing filtering and smoothing problems in continuous time --- but our findings are indicative about weakly informative settings beyond this context too. We study the performance of different resampling schemes, such as systematic resampling, SSP (Srinivasan sampling process) and stratified resampling, as the time-discretisation becomes finer and also identify their continuous-time limit, which is expressed as a suitably defined infinitesimal generator.\u0026rsquo; By contrasting these generators, we find that (certain modifications of) systematic and SSP resampling dominate' stratified and independent killing\u0026rsquo; resampling in terms of their limiting overall resampling rate. The reduced intensity of resampling manifests itself in lower variance in our numerical experiment. This efficiency result, through an ordering of the resampling rate, is new to the literature. The second major contribution of this work concerns the analysis of the limiting behaviour of the entire population of particles of the particle filter as the time discretisation becomes finer. We provide the first proof, under general conditions, that the particle approximation of the discretised continuous-time Feynman-Kac path integral models converges to a (uniformly weighted) continuous-time particle system.\nJoint work with N.

Unlike traditional synchronization methods that rely on internal models or reference models, autonomous synchronization allows agents to achieve synchronization without prior knowledge of synchronized agent dynamics or synchronized state trajectories. Instead, these features emerge autonomously through the network interactions and the inherent properties and initial states of each agent, thus providing a multi-agent system with more degrees of adaptability and higher synchronization efficiency. A two-level controller is introduced to address the autonomous synchronization problem, comprising a dynamics update law and a synchronizing control law. This controller framework enables the achievement of autonomous synchronization in heterogeneous MASs. Furthermore, the talk emphasizes that the theory of autonomous synchronization is still in its early stages of research, with ample opportunities for further investigation and advancements.\nBio: Dr. Yamin Yan received the B.E. degree from Wuyuzhang Honors College in Automation, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, in 2017.

At the same time, the energy infrastructure is evolving from a collection of independently built, isolated energy carrier networks towards globally-integrated multi-energy systems. The integration of networks is clearly beneficial in view of designing optimal sustainable energy systems, but their heavily interconnected nature makes them vulnerable to cascading failures with potentially catastrophic consequences. This talk addresses the grand challenges and presents the methodological developments necessary to guide the evolution of energy infrastructure through vulnerability-based adaptation. They encompass (i) the development of high-fidelity, efficient mathematical models for quantifying the risk of cascading failures across the power infrastructure; (ii) investigating the trade-offs and optimal solutions in the energy trilemma for active distribution networks; (iii) developing and validating early warning indicators of critical transitions and fault diagnosis tools in complex dynamical systems; (iv) quantifying the cost of resilience in the design of carbon capture, transport and storage supply chains.

A powerful set of tracking control algorithms have been developed over the last half-century, however, these tools often rely on local coordinates or extrinsic features of the system state space. Initial work in equivariant systems theory has begun addressing these shortcomings for systems with transitive symmetries.

We explore the usage of event cameras for predicting time-to-contact (TTC) with the surface during ventral landing. This is achieved by estimating divergence (inverse TTC), which is the rate of radial optic flow, from the event stream generated during landing. Our core contributions are a novel contrast maximisation formulation for event-based divergence estimation, and a branch-and-bound algorithm to exactly maximise contrast and find the optimal divergence value. GPU acceleration is conducted to speed up the global algorithm. Another contribution is a new dataset containing real event streams from ventral landing that was employed to test and benchmark our method. Owing to global optimisation, our algorithm is much more capable at recovering the true divergence, compared to other heuristic divergence estimators or event-based optic flow methods. With GPU acceleration, our method also achieves competitive runtimes.\nThe paper was published at ECCV’s AI for Space Workshop.\n","date":"23 March 2023","permalink":"/seminars/sofiamcleod/","section":"","summary":"Title: Globally Optimal Event-Based Divergence Estimation for Ventral Landing\nTime, Date, Location: 14:00, Thursday, 23 March, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: Event sensing is a major component in bio-inspired flight guidance and control systems.","title":"Sofia McLeod's Talk on Globally Optimal Event-Based Divergence Estimation for Ventral Landing"},{"content":"Title: Games as Graphs\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 17 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: In this talk we re-examine the utility foundations of game theory.

Various techniques have been proposed to solve this state estimation problem, such as Luenberger-like observers and extended Kalman filter, which are also widely used in real world systems. In the last 20 years, driving by the unmanned aerial vehicle industry, there has been a burst of works in novel geometric observer design for attitude and pose estimation by exploiting the symmetry of the systems.

One proposed a general filter design methodology of discrete-time systems on homogeneous spaces, while the other one presented how this filter can be applied to inertial navigation systems. Additionally, plan for future work that extends the current filter architecture are detailed with short-term plans, both coming with derivations.

However, the growing availability of data and advancements in computing power has given rise to a resurgence of operator-theoretic approaches such as the Koopman framework, which has been realised in algorithms like the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Such approaches involve embedding a nonlinear, finite-dimensional system in an infinite-dimensional space of functions, whose time evolution can be described by a linear operator. Along similar lines, this tutorial-style talk will discuss how the evolution of the value function for a nonlinear optimal control problem can be approximated in a computationally efficient manner. In particular, the Dynamic Programming Principle, which relates the value function at two time points, is a linear operator in a max-plus semi-vector space of functions. This then allows the value function to be evolved as if it were a discrete-time linear system.

Albeit this intrinsic choice of the cost functional, the resulting optimal control problem can be singular, i.e., it is in general not coercive in the control variable. However to the dissipative structure of port-Hamiltonian systems and the strong intertwinement of cost and dynamics, we show under suitable assumptions that, despite this singularity, optimal controls exist, can be characterized by optimality conditions and exhibit a particular stability behavior towards a conservative subspace.\nTitle: Model predictive control for systems with null-controllable homogeneous approximation\nAbstract: The stabilization of non-holonomic mobile robots is challenging according to A. Astolfi, see [1]. In particular, it was shown in [2] that the set-point stabilization cannot be achieved using MPC based on quadratic costs without stabilizing terminal conditions. A remedy is the use of tailored stage or terminal costs, see, e.g. [3]. In the first part of the talk, we recap these findings. Then, we present the framework proposed in [4], which allows to systematically design stage costs such that local asymptotic stability of the origin w.r.t. the MPC closed loop is ensured for a system class including the mobile-robot example. To this end, we show that cost controllability, a sufficient stability condition, holds making use of the homogeneous approximation.\n[1] A. Astolfi: Discontinuous control of nonholonomic systems.

Existing solutions provide limited stability guarantees, relying on local linearisation, high gain design, or assuming specific trajectories such as constant acceleration of the vehicle. In this presentation, I discuss a novel non-linear observer for inertial VAA with almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable error dynamics. The approach exploits Lie group symmetries of the system dynamics to construct a globally valid correction term. To the authors\u0026rsquo; knowledge, this construction is the first observer to provide almost global convergence for the inertial VAA problem. The observer performance is verified in simulation, where it is shown that the estimation error converges to zero even with an extremely poor initial condition.\nTitle: Exploiting Symmetries for Trajectory Tracking Control (with Application to Quadrotors) by Matthew Hampsey\nAbstract: High performance trajectory tracking control of quadrotor vehicles is an important challenge in aerial robotics. Symmetry is a fundamental property of physical systems and offers the potential to provide a tool to design high-performance control algorithms. We propose a design methodology that takes any given symmetry, linearises the associated error in a single set of coordinates, and uses LQR design to obtain a high performance control; an approach we term Equivariant Regulator design. We show that quadrotor vehicles admit several different symmetries: the direct product symmetry, the extended pose symmetry and the pose and velocity symmetry, and show that each symmetry can be used to define a global error. We compare the linearised systems via simulation and find that the extended pose and pose and velocity symmetries outperform the direct product symmetry in the presence of large disturbances. This suggests that choices of equivariant and group affine symmetries have improved linearisation error.\n","date":"9 December 2022","permalink":"/seminars/mh_pvg/","section":"","summary":"We have a double-bill.\nTime, Date, Location: 11:00, Friday, 9 December, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nThe details are given below.\nTitle: Constructive Equivariant Observer Design for Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude by Pieter van Goor","title":"Pieter van Goor's Talk on Constructive Equivariant Observer Design for Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude and Matthew Hampsey's Talk on Exploiting Symmetries for Trajectory Tracking Control"},{"content":"Title: SubT and Beyond: Experiences at the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and Putting Robots to Work\nTime, Date, Location: 15:00, Wednesday, 7 December, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room\nAbstract: he DARPA SubT Challenge concluded in September 2021, Team CSIRO Data61 placed second, securing 1 million USD for Australian robotics.

First, we consider how measurement leaks about a linear, discrete, time-invariant system\u0026rsquo;s dynamics helps an adversary to calculate attacks that are difficult to detect. It turns out that these undetectable attacks can be generated with small amounts of input-output data using Willems’ Fundamental Lemma. Insight into the attack generation shows that security may be obtained through sudden changes in the system. In the second part of the talk, we will consider how injected measurement noise makes these sudden events difficult to estimate for an adversary. In particular, we use the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to provide lower bounds on the estimation error variance of when the change has occurred, which is difficult to do with traditional methods such as Cramér-Rao due to the time-step being discrete. We also present extensions of to our analysis to nonlinear systems and to simultaneous estimation of the amplitude and the time-step of the change using the Barankin bound. The latter result enables us to design open-loop control sequences that reduce information leakage. Finally, we use numerical simulations to verify our results in a smart-home setting, and to show how a forensic analysis can be made.\nBiography: Rijad Alisic is a Ph.D. student with the Division of Decision and Control Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of Henrik Sandberg and co-supervisor Karl Henrik Johansson.

It computes on-line the optimal least mean square error estimate of the state given the observed outputs, and it also computes the covariance matrix of the state estimation error. Using the state estimate and the covariance matrix, a confidence ellipsoid for the true state can be constructed under the assumption that the noise in the system is Gaussian.\nIn many applications some values of the states are more important than others, e.g. values that represent collision or near-collision of two robots, unsafe operating conditions etc. Such events usually have low a priori probability to happen and the Kalman Filter fails to provide adequate estimates and confidence ellipsoids of such rare events. In this talk a state estimation algorithm which under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, delivers confidence ellipsoids which contain the true state, regardless of its value, with a given probability is presented. The results will first be introduced for the static case, and before extended to the dynamic case.\nJoint work with Algo Care and Marco Campi, University of Brescia, Italy.\nRef: A. Care, M.

While Kalman filtering technique has achieved a great success in tracking a moving target over the past few decades, it requires some model assumption on the target dynamics and noise statistics. In this talk, we consider a time-varying optimization approach to the target tracking problem using noisy time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, which imposes only minimal assumptions on the target trajectory and/or noise distribution. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a sequence of TOA-based source localization problem and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to generate sequential updates of the target. To analyze the tracking performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of the (static) TOA-based source localization problem. Under standard assumptions on the TOA measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at different noise levels.\nBiography: Yuen-Man Pun is currently a postdoctoral fellow with CIICADA Lab, School of Engineering at Australian National University.

In this talk we present two scenarios where hybrid techniques can be used to solve two important estimation problems. In the first part, we consider the scenario where a system transmits its measurements to an observer via a digital network. In this context, an important question is when a transmission needs to occur over the network to obtain accurate state estimates, while only sporadically using the communication channel. For this purpose, we present a (hybrid) event-triggered observer design. In the second part of the talk, we use hybrid techniques with the aim of improving the estimation performance of a given robust nominal observer designed for a general nonlinear continuous-time system. We present for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal one and additional dynamical systems that differ from the nominal observer only in their output injection gains, that are collectively referred to as modes. We then evaluate the estimation cost of each mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at each time instant. Different strategies are proposed to reset, or not, the modes which are not selected at each switching instant. Simulation results show that the nominal observer performances can be significantly improved with the proposed scheme.\nBiography: Elena Petri is a PhD student at CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France, under the supervision of Romain Postoyan (CRAN, Université de Lorraine, France), Dragan Nesic (University of Melbourne, Australia) and Daniele Astolfi (LAGEPP, Université Lyon 1, France).
