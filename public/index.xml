      <description>We are conducting research that seeks to enable engineered systems to infer the criteria of optimality underlying the actions and decisions of experts. This research has thus far explored fundamental theory and practical algorithms for studying the mid-air collision avoidance behaviour of birds, the driving behaviour of humans, and the decisions of players in competition and conflict.</description>

      <description>Our ongoing research into equivariant systems has yielded a range of state estimation algorithms for systems on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces. We develop the general framework of equivariant systems theory to yield generic observer designs such as the Equivariant Filter (EqF), which has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in problems such as attitude estimation and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).</description>
