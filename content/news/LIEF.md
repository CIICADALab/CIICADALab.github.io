Our project led by Dr. Liz Ratnam has been successful in the latest ARC Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) round. The project is the result of successful collaboration between academics from ANU, the University of Sydney, and the University of Newcastle.

The following is the excerpt about our project from [ARC's media release](https://www.arc.gov.au/news-publications/media/media-releases/39-million-awarded-build-research-infrastructure-equipment-and-facilities).

> The Australian National University ($400,000): Establishing a National Facility for Electricity Grid Security and Resilience Research. This facility will enable large-scale industrial control systems to be better engineered for improved robustness and resilience and reduce the risk of power blackouts caused by cybersecurity threats.
