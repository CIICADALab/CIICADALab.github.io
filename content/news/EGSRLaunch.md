Our project led by Dr. Liz Ratnam has been successful in the latest ARC Linkage
Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) round. The project is the result
of successful collaboration between academics from ANU, the University of
Sydney, and the University of Newcastle. 

We will have a workshop to launch the project on 1 September 2023. The workshop
will be attended by industry and academics, including Opal-RT. 

Weâ€™d like to invite you and your research groups to attend the workshop (please
register using the link on the flyer for catering purposes).

Looking forward to welcoming you and your team to Canberra.
