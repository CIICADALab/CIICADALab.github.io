__Title:__ Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for State Feedback Equivalence to Negative Imaginary Systems

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 24 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ We present necessary and sufficient conditions under which a linear
time-invariant (LTI) system is state feedback equivalent to a negative imaginary
(NI) system. More precisely, we show that a minimal LTI strictly proper system
can be rendered NI using full state feedback if and only if it can be output
transformed into a system, which has relative degree less than or equal to two
and is weakly minimum phase. Then we apply the NI state feedback equivalence
result to robustly stabilize an uncertain system with strictly negative
imaginary uncertainty. A real-world example is provided to illustrate the
proposed results, for the purpose of stabilizing an uncertain system.
