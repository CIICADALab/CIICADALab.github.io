__Title:__  Analysis and Synthesis of Heterogeneous Multi-agent System via Blended
Dynamics Approach


__Time, Date, Location__: 10:00, Friday, 3 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ This talk emphasizes that a group of heterogeneous multi-agent dynamics
exhibits an emergence of new behavior when some parts of the dynamics are
enforced to synchronize, and the new behavior can be represented by the
so-called blended dynamics. This fact is utilized for analysis of the
behavior of coupled oscillators and for explaining how a large number of
agents in a group can enhance the robustness of the group. The fact, when
viewed in a different angle, can also be used for synthesis of a
heterogeneous multi-agent system intended for distributed computation. We
demonstrate a few applications of the designs in this talk. A discrete-time
version and a hybrid system version of the blended dynamics theorem are
also discussed.

__Bio:__ Hyungbo Shim received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National
University, Korea, and held the post-doc position at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. Since 2003, he has been with Seoul National
University, now the director of Automation and Systems Research Institute.
He has served as an associate editor for Automatica and IEEE Trans. on
Automatic Control. He is the general chair of IFAC World Congress 2026. His
research interests include stability analysis of nonlinear systems,
observer design, disturbance observer technique, secure control systems,
and synchronization for multi-agent systems.
