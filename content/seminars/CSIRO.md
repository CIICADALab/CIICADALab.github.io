__Title:__  SubT and Beyond: Experiences at the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and Putting Robots to Work


__Time, Date, Location__: 15:00, Wednesday, 7 December, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__  he DARPA SubT Challenge concluded in September 2021, Team CSIRO Data61 placed second, securing 1 million USD for Australian robotics. Fletcher and Brendan are with the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group in CSIRO’s Data61, and will discuss some of the technical solutions developed over the last 3 years to overcome the challenges of autonomous underground exploration to beat some of the world’s best on the global stage. We will provide insight into our experiences as robot operators throughout the competition, and some of the challenges we faced leading up to the final event. The technology developed in SubT has found a place tending to the farms of the future. We will introduce the Reimagine Farming concept and discuss the applications of multi-robot autonomy in unstructured farmland, including the progress made since the competition, and plans for future development.
