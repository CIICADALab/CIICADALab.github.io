__Title:__  Threats of Robust/Sampling/Enforced Zero-dynamics Attacks, and
Countermeasures against Them


__Time, Date, Location__: 10:00, Friday, 10 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ Control systems, or cyber-physical-systems, are not safe in the modern
world where most signals are communicated over a network, due to the risks
of cyber-attacks. In this talk, we introduce a few recently discovered
attack methods that are hidden from anomaly detectors but still lethal. Two
countermeasures against zero-dynamics attacks are introduced. Generalized
holder and generalized sampler are generalized devices of zero-order hold
and simpler sampler, respectively. In this talk, we will show that these
generalized devices can neutralize the zero-dynamics attacks and discuss
how to design them.

__Bio:__ Hyungbo Shim received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National
University, Korea, and held the post-doc position at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. Since 2003, he has been with Seoul National
University, now the director of Automation and Systems Research Institute.
He has served as an associate editor for Automatica and IEEE Trans. on
Automatic Control. He is the general chair of IFAC World Congress 2026. His
research interests include stability analysis of nonlinear systems,
observer design, disturbance observer technique, secure control systems,
and synchronization for multi-agent systems.
