__Title:__  Hybrid techniques for state estimation: event-triggered observer design and observer performance improvement

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 21 October, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ While hybrid techniques have demonstrated their relevance and strength in a range of control problems, they have been much less exploited in the context of estimation. In this talk we present two scenarios where hybrid techniques can be used to solve two important estimation problems. In the first part, we consider the scenario where a system transmits its measurements to an observer via a digital network. In this context, an important question is when a transmission needs to occur over the network to obtain accurate state estimates, while only sporadically using the communication channel. For this purpose, we present a (hybrid) event-triggered observer design. In the second part of the talk, we use hybrid techniques with the aim of improving the estimation performance of a given robust nominal observer designed for a general nonlinear continuous-time system. We present for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal one and additional dynamical systems that differ from the nominal observer only in their output injection gains, that are collectively referred to as modes. We then evaluate the estimation cost of each mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at each time instant. Different strategies are proposed to reset, or not, the modes which are not selected at each switching instant. Simulation results show that the nominal observer performances can be significantly improved with the proposed scheme.
