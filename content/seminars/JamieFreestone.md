__Title:__ Philosophy, feedback, and representations


__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, June 3, 2023, Brian Anderson Seminar Room


__Abstract:__ Many branches of philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive science have tackled the
problem of mental representations: how can one part of the physical world - a
brain - be about or represent some other part of the world? The problem extends
to external representations too, like images, words, data, symbols, etc. A
"textbook" response says that mental representations are a system of three
parts: (1) a vehicle that instantiates the representation, such as a particular
network of neurons; (2) the content carried by that vehicle, i.e. what it is
about; and (3) and the target of the representation, which is the object or
feature of the world being represented. Many philosophers find this problematic.
I suggest how progress might be made with lessons drawn from how representations
are dealt with in technical disciplines.
