__Title:__  Perception, planning and learning for robot grasping and interaction

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 31 March, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__  The tremendous potential offered by robotic automation has been evidenced by its
revolution of large scale manufacturing, mining, and agriculture. Now, with
increasing social and economic pressures to transfer this success to
service-focused sectors, we're seeing robots moving into our shops, our
hospitals, and our homes. The types of sorting, fetching, and tidying tasks that
we're increasingly demanding of our robots rely on robust, object-instance-level
perception, along with agent-aware planning algorithms for safe and effective
physical interactions. This talk will discuss the tight connections between
perception, planning and learning for robot grasping and nonprehensile
interaction with articulated objects. We will also take an outlook on how these
skills can be combined to achieve robots that can adapt to solve long horizon
tasks.

__Bio:__ Jen Jen Chung is an Associate Professor in Mechatronics within the School of
Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at The University of
Queensland. Her current research interests include perception, planning and
learning for robotic mobile manipulation, algorithms for robot navigation
through human crowds, informative path planning and adaptive sampling. Prior to
working at UQ, Jen Jen was a Senior Researcher in the Autonomous Systems Lab
(ASL) at ETH ZÃ¼rich from 2018-2022 and was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon
State University researching multiagent learning methods from 2014-2017. She
completed her Ph.D. on information-based exploration-exploitation strategies for
autonomous soaring platforms at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics in the
University of Sydney. She received her Ph.D. (2014) and B.E. (2010) from the
University of Sydney.
