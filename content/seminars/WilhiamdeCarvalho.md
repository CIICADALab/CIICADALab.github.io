__Title:__ Optimisation and control of distributed energy resources for power and voltage regulation in distribution networks


__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, May 19, 2023, [Zoom Link](https://anu.zoom.us/j/81642882998?pwd=dCtJSW5NaEFkN2ZlRFdTcEpydDVmUT09)



__Abstract:__ While the adoption of solar power, battery storage and electric
vehicles continues to grow worldwide, both technical challenges and
opportunities emerge in electricity networks. This talk will explore
optimisation and control approaches to operate such distributed energy resources
(DERs) to mitigate operational challenges in distribution grids. We formulate
convex optimisation problems to design control parameters or to directly
dispatch real and reactive power of battery storage. Different formulations for
the local volt-var-watt proportional control are also explored and presented in
this talk.


__Bio:__: Wilhiam received his B.Sc. at the Western Paraná State University and
M.Sc. at the University of São Paulo, both in electrical engineering with a
focus on power systems. He is currently working towards his PhD at the
Australian National University doing research on applying optimisation and
control approaches to operate the future electricity grid with high integration
of DERs.
