__Title:__ Nonlinear trajectory tracking on homogeneous spaces


__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 13 April, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ Accurate tracking of planned trajectories in the presence of
perturbations is a fundamental problem in control and robotics. A powerful set
of tracking control algorithms have been developed over the last half-century,
however, these tools often rely on local coordinates or extrinsic features of
the system state space.  Initial work in equivariant systems theory has begun
addressing these shortcomings for systems with transitive symmetries. Symmetry
is a fundamental mathematical feature of many dynamical systems and allows for
intrinsic formulations of much of the structure required for these control
tools.  In this thesis proposal review, I present a recent conference paper of
ours which formulates a geometrically motivated linear tracking controller for
input-affine systems on homogeneous spaces.  Additionally, I present my plans
for future work in the area of geometric control for equivariant systems.
