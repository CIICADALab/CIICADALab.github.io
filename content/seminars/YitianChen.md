__Title:__  Regret Analysis of Online LQR Control via Trajectory Prediction and Tracking


__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 3 February, 2022, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__  In this paper, we propose and analyse a new method for online
linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control with a priori unknown time-varying cost
matrices. The cost matrices are revealed sequentially with future values to be
previewed over a short window. Our novel method involves using the available
cost matrices to predict the optimal trajectory along with a tracking controller
to drive the system towards it which is less "pessimistic" than other existing
methods. We adopted the notion of dynamic regret to measure the performance of
this proposed  online LQR control method, with our main result being that the
(dynamic) regret of our method is upper bounded by a constant. Moreover, the
regret upper bound decays exponentially with the preview window length, and is
extendable to systems with disturbances. We show in simulations that our
proposed method offers improved performance compared to other previously
proposed online LQR methods.
