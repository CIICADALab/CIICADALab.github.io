__Title:__ Modeling and Operating of Complex Engineering Systems

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 18 August, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room



__Abstract:__ In this talk, we will discuss a couple of modeling and operation methods for complex engineering systems from aircraft to power generators to power and energy systems. We first illustrate the parameter estimation of superposed failure data collected from aircraft and develop the Wiener degradation model with unit-to-unit variability for service-based maintenance of gas turbines. We also demonstrate various AI techniques for predictive maintenance and load forecasting in power and energy systems. Finally, we discuss the modeling and robust mitigation of smart grids subject to extreme events, such as bushfires and cyber-attacks in an online manner. 


__Bio:__ Dr. Huadong Mo is now a Senior Lecturer at the School of Systems and Computing, University of New South Wales, Australia. Before joining UNSW in 2019 as a Lecturer, he was a postdoc at the Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, EHTZ, Switzerland from 2016 to 2019. He received his B.E. degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology of China, China in 2012; and his Ph.D. degree in systems engineering and engineering management from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong in 2016. His research interests include advanced sensing and data analysis for prognostics and health management, sustainable transportation and energy systems, robust operation of power and energy systems under extreme events and (Quantum-inspired) reinforcement learning-based lifelong asset management.
