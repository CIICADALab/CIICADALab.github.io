__Title:__ Games as Graphs

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 17 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ In this talk we re-examine the utility foundations of game
theory. We present a simple and intuitive model of a game defined
precisely by each player's preference orders of their strategies, given
the strategies of the other players. These orders define a graph called
the 'response graph' of the game. We discuss why the response graph is
a natural model. Most importantly, we find that the graph-based
approach leads to new insights and predictions that improve upon our
understanding of game theory, particularly evolution in game
