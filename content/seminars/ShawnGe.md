__Title:__ Equivariant Observer Design for Discrete-time Systems

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 10 February, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room

__Abstract:__ State observer design for nonlinear systems is a key field in
control theories. Various techniques have been proposed to solve this state
estimation problem, such as Luenberger-like observers and extended Kalman
filter, which are also widely used in real world systems. In the last 20 years,
driving by the unmanned aerial vehicle industry, there has been a burst of works
in novel geometric observer design for attitude and pose estimation by
exploiting the symmetry of the systems. This leads to my research topic of
equivariant observer designs. In this Thesis Proposal Review, two papers are
presented. One proposed a general filter design methodology of discrete-time
systems on homogeneous spaces, while the other one presented how this filter can
be applied to inertial navigation systems. Additionally, plan for future work
that extends the current filter architecture are detailed with short-term plans,
both coming with derivations. The future direction addresses how I would like to
generalize the current work onto a broader class of systems, with some
early-stage insights of the ideas. The resources and logistics required for the
future plans are provided.
