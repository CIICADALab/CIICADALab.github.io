__Title:__  Equivariant filter for discrete-time systems

__Abstract:__ The kinematics of many nonlinear systems, especially in the robotics field, admit a transitive Liegroup symmetry, which is useful in high performance observer design. The recently proposed equivariant filter (EqF) exploits equivariance to generate high performance filters for a wide range of real-world systems. However, existing work on the equivariant filter, and equivariance of control systems in general, is based on a continuous-time formulation. In this work, we first present the equivariant structure of a discrete-time system, as well as the link between the equivariance of a discrete-time system and its continuous-time counterpart. We then use this to propose a discrete-time version of the equivariant filter. A novelty of the approach is that the geometry of the symmetry group naturally appears as parallel transport in the reset step of the filter. Preliminary results for linear second order kinematics with separate bearing and range measurements indicate that the discrete EqF significantly outperforms both a discretised version of the continuous EqF and a classical discrete EKF.
