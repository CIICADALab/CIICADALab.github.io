__Title:__  Quantum detector tomography: analytical algorithm, optimal design and regularization


__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, May 12, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room



__Abstract:__ Quantum detector tomography (QDT) is a fundamental technique used
for calibrating quantum devices and performing various quantum engineering
tasks. In this talk, we will first provide a brief introduction to quantum
physics and quantum tomography. We will then propose a two-stage analytical
algorithm in QDT. Using this algorithm, we will further investigate optimal and
adaptive designs for probe states to enhance estimation accuracy. However, in
practice, probe states are often limited, which is why we will also explore the
use of regularization techniques to solve this problem.

__Bio:__ Shuixin Xiao received a B.E. degree in automation from Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018.  He is currently
working toward the Ph.D. degree in a joint Ph.D. program with Shanghai Jiao Tong
University, Shanghai, China, and the University of New South Wales, Canberra,
ACT, Australia. Now he is also a Research Assistant at The Australian National
University. His current research interests include quantum system
identification, quantum computing, and quantum information processing.
