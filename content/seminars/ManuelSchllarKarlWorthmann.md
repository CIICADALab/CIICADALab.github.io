__Title:__ Structure-exploiting optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems

__Abstract:__ We consider optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems by minimizing 
the energy supplied via the ports. Albeit this intrinsic choice of the 
cost functional, the resulting optimal control problem can be singular, 
i.e., it is in general not coercive in the control variable. However to 
the dissipative structure of port-Hamiltonian systems and the strong 
intertwinement of cost and dynamics, we show under suitable assumptions 
that, despite this singularity, optimal controls exist, can be 
characterized by optimality conditions and exhibit a particular 
stability behavior towards a conservative subspace.


__Title:__  Model predictive control for systems with null-controllable homogeneous approximation



__Abstract:__  The stabilization of non-holonomic mobile robots is challenging 
according to A. Astolfi, see [1]. In particular, it was shown in [2] 
that the set-point stabilization cannot be achieved using MPC based on 
quadratic costs without stabilizing terminal conditions. A remedy is the 
use of tailored stage or terminal costs, see, e.g. [3]. In the first 
part of the talk, we recap these findings. Then, we present the 
framework proposed in [4], which allows to systematically design stage 
costs such that local asymptotic stability of the origin w.r.t. the MPC 
closed loop is ensured for a system class including the mobile-robot 
example. To this end, we show that cost controllability, a sufficient 
stability condition, holds making use of the homogeneous approximation.

__Bios:__ Manuel Schaller obtained a M.Sc. in Mathematics in 2017 from the 
University of Bayreuth with focus on PDE-constrained optimization and 
numerics. In 2021, he received a PhD in Applied Mathematics at the 
University of Bayreuth under the joint supervision of Prof. Lars Grüne 
and Prof. Anton Schiela. During this time, his research was focused on 
stability and sensitivity analysis of (infinite-dimensional) optimal 
control problems, in particular turnpike theory and efficient space-time 
finite element discretizations for Model Predictive Control.

Currently, Manuel is with the Optimization-based Control Group at 
Technische Universität Ilmenau, where he holds a position as Lecturer. 
In his research, he focusses on singular optimal control of 
port-Hamiltonian systems and guarantees for data-based surrogate models 
for control systems with particular applications in retinal laser 
treatment and adaptive high-rise buildings.

In 2020, he was appointed as GAMM (German Association of Applied 
Mathematics and Mechanics) Junior fellow.

Karl Worthmann received his Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the 
University of Bayreuth, Germany, in 2012. 2014 he was appointed 
assistant professor for ''Differential Equations'' at Technische 
Universität Ilmenau (TU Ilmenau), Germany. 2019 he was promoted to full 
professor after receiving the Heisenberg-professorship 
''Optimization-based Control'' by the German Research Foundation in 
2018. He was recipient of the Ph.D. Award from the City of Bayreuth, 
Germany, and stipend of the German National Academic Foundation. 2013 he 
has been appointed Junior Fellow of the Society of Applied Mathematics 
and Mechanics (GAMM), where he served as speaker in 2014 and 2015. 
Currently, Karl Worthmann is chairman "Mathematical Systems Theory" of 
the interdisciplinary GAMM activity group "Dynamics and Control Theory" 
and recently served as programme co-chair for the MTNS 2022. Karl 
Worthmann's current research interests include systems and control 
theory with a particular focus on nonlinear model predictive control, 
stability analysis, and data-driven control.
