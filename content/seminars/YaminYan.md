__Title:__ Towards Autonomous Synchronization: Introducing Open Problems in Coordinating Diverse Dynamic Agents

__Time, Date, Location__: 11:00, Friday, 11 August, 2023, Brian Anderson Building Seminar Room



__Abstract:__ This talk focuses on a new synchronization problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, called autonomous synchronization. Unlike traditional synchronization methods that rely on internal models or reference models, autonomous synchronization allows agents to achieve synchronization without prior knowledge of synchronized agent dynamics or synchronized state trajectories. Instead, these features emerge autonomously through the network interactions and the inherent properties and initial states of each agent, thus providing a multi-agent system with more degrees of adaptability and higher synchronization efficiency. A two-level controller is introduced to address the autonomous synchronization problem, comprising a dynamics update law and a synchronizing control law. This controller framework enables the achievement of autonomous synchronization in heterogeneous MASs. Furthermore, the talk emphasizes that the theory of autonomous synchronization is still in its early stages of research, with ample opportunities for further investigation and advancements.


__Bio:__ Dr. Yamin Yan received the B.E. degree from Wuyuzhang Honors College in Automation, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, in 2017. She worked as a Research Associate at the University of Newcastle, Australia, from 2018 to 2021. She is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering/ the CKS Robotics Institute, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), as well as an adjunct lecturer at the University of Newcastle. Her research interests include networked systems and control, cyber-physical systems, and security control. She was a selected participant in the 2022 Asian Deans' Forum-The Rising Stars Women in Engineering Workshop. She is also a recipient of the 2022 Royal Society International Kan Tong Po Visiting Fellowship, the 2019 Future Women Leaders Conference Award for women in STEM from Monash University, Australia, the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA) Best Paper Finalist, and 2017 CUHK Faculty Outstanding Tutors Award.
