{{< lead >}}
Our ongoing research into equivariant systems has yielded a range of state estimation algorithms for systems on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces.
We develop the general framework of equivariant systems theory to yield generic observer designs such as the Equivariant Filter (EqF), which has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in problems such as attitude estimation and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).
This research also examines system invariances that can be exploited to yield observers with synchronous error dynamics (depending only on a choice of correction term) and (almost-)global stability properties.
