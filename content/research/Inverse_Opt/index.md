{{< lead >}}
We are conducting research that seeks to enable engineered systems to infer the criteria of optimality underlying the actions and decisions of experts. This research has thus far explored fundamental theory and practical algorithms for studying the mid-air collision avoidance behaviour of birds, the driving behaviour of humans, and the decisions of players in competition and conflict. The broad applicability and versatility of our research is due to its focus on understanding the fundamental structure of these inverse problems, and their connections to the mathematics of optimal control and dynamic game theory.
