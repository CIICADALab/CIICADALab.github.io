{{< lead >}}
Even after more than 100 years, Lyapunov methods still are one of the main tools in the controller design and in the stability analysis of dynamical systems. In recent years the focus has shifted from stability to safety and obstacle avoidance. In this research stream we focus on combined problems of asymptotic stability and simultaneous obstacle avoidance for (nonlinear) constrained underactuated systems. Combining results on nonsmooth Lyapunov and control Lyapunov functions, hybrid systems and discontinuous feedback laws we focus on theoretical results as well explicit control formulations and controller designs.
