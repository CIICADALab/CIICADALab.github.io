{{< lead >}}
In this research stream we focus on developing an integrated perception, decision, and control framework for a novel autonomy stack that incorporates the inherent uncertainties and nonlinearities of robotic systems. Combining results from nonlinear control, optimal control, formal methods, and estimation theory as well as cutting edge nonlinear and stochastic programming and planning methods,  we focus on developing a perception, decision, and control framework for safe autonomous systems.
